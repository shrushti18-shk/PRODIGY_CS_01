# PRODIGY_CS_01 – Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

This repository contains **Task 1** of my **Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy Infotech**.

The project is a **Python program** that encrypts and decrypts text using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**.

---

## 📌 What is Caesar Cipher?

Caesar Cipher is a **simple substitution encryption technique** where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

### Example:
- Message: `HELLO`
- Shift: `3`
- Encrypted: `KHOOR`

---

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypts text using a user-defined shift value
- Decrypts the encrypted text back to the original message
- Supports both **uppercase and lowercase letters**
- Keeps spaces and special characters unchanged

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
